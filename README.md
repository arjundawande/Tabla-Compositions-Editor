# Tabla Compositions Editor

A simple web-based editor designed for tabla musicians to quickly write compositions without the hassle of typing in Devanagari script on English keyboards.

## 🎯 Problem & Solution

Many tabla disciples face frustration when trying to compose on digital devices because:
- Devanagari keyboards are often unavailable
- Switching keyboard layouts is time-consuming.
- Traditional methods don't support quick, efficient composition

**Tabla Compositions Editor** solves this by providing an intuitive interface with basic tabla notation buttons, allowing musicians to focus on their compositions rather than technical hurdles.

**Note:** These compositions and the custom buttons are stored on your device using LocalStorage, so no one **except you** can have access to these and are completely private and safe.
**Make sure you don't accidentally delete the site data as it will lead to deletion of all your compositions.**
